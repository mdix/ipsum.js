# ipsum.js

## Preamble
Just a quick midnight implementation. Will... could... may... might be improved sooner or later. :) 

## Why?
Because it's a provides a quick and efficient way to check if a just designed webpage / webapp can cope with more, less or no text inside its text elements (happens often when using CMS). 

## So this is how you use it:
Insert the script into your page and press alt+ or alt- to add / remove some text or alt 0 to remove the text completely.

## TODO
- check if element contains childs
- check if element is empty (this collides with clearing, maybe clear but leave a html comment so we can fill the elem again)
